# habit-tracker-go

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Created partially to familiarize myself with the Go programming language and to track time of my own daily routines.

Key features:

- Creating a habit by providing a number of daily intervals and their time.
- Tracking daily time spent on a habit.
- Checking whether the daily objective has been fulfilled. Has a user done less/more than the desired objective.
- Allowing to freeze a habit when a user has currently no time for it due to real life obligations.

When the application is executed and a day or more have passed the data is recalculated.
All of the data is stored in a json file and can be displayed in a tabular form.
